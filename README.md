## Topic: Process Creation and Management Using Python OS Module

### Course Details  
**Course Code & Name:** ENCS351 Operating System  
**Program:** B.Tech CSE "CORE"

## Project Overview

This project simulates Linux process management using Python. It replicates key operating system behaviors such as process creation, command execution, zombie/orphan process scenarios, process inspection via `/proc`, and process prioritization with `nice` values.

---

## Assignment Objectives

- Understand Linux process lifecycle and management.
- Create child processes and execute system commands programmatically.
- Simulate and observe zombie and orphan processes.
- Inspect and extract process information from the `/proc` filesystem.
- Demonstrate the impact of process priority on scheduling.

## Tasks Implemented

1. **Process Creation Utility**  
   Creates N child processes using `os.fork()`. Each child prints its PID and parent PID, followed by a custom message. The parent waits for all children to finish.

2. **Command Execution Using `exec()`**  
   Modifies task 1 so each child executes Linux commands such as `ls`, `date`, or `ps` using `os.execvp()`.

3. **Zombie and Orphan Processes Simulation**  
   Demonstrates zombie processes by skipping `wait()` in the parent and orphan processes by exiting the parent before child termination.

4. **Process Inspection from `/proc`**  
   Takes a PID input and displays process status, executable path, and open file descriptors by reading `/proc/[pid]/` files.

5. **Process Prioritization Using Nice Values**  
   Launches multiple CPU-intensive child processes with varying nice values and observes the order of execution influenced by process priority.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you are on a **Linux** system with **Python 3** installed. The script uses Linux-specific modules and filesystem paths.  
2. Clone or download the repository and navigate into the project directory.  
3. Run the Python script:
4. For Task 4, provide a valid PID when prompted, or press Enter to skip.  
5. For Task 3, observe zombie processes from another terminal by running:  
6. The script outputs messages for each task indicating process creation, command execution, and task completion.
