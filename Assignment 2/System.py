Problem Title:
System Startup, Process Creation, and Termination Simulation in Python

Problem Statement:
Modern operating systems are responsible for initializing system components, creating processes, managing execution, and gracefully shutting down. This lab aims to simulate these core concepts using Python, helping students visualize how processes are handled at the OS level. The focus is on creating a simplified startup mechanism that spawns multiple processes and logs their lifecycle using the multiprocessing and logging modules. This hands-on simulation enhances conceptual clarity and promotes coding proficiency in scripting real-world OS behavior.

Learning Objectives:
Upon completing this lab, students will be able to:

Understand the concepts of system booting, process creation, and termination.
Develop Python scripts using the multiprocessing and logging modules.
Simulate system behavior using programming constructs.
Tools/Technologies Used:
Python 3.x
multiprocessing module
time module
logging module
Assignment Tasks:
Task Overview:
Write a Python script to simulate a basic system startup sequence:

Use the multiprocessing module to create at least two child processes that perform dummy tasks.
Implement proper logging to track process start and end times.
Generate a log file (process_log.txt) to reflect system-like behavior.
Submit the Python script and log file along with a short report explaining your implementation.
